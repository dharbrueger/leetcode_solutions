# leetcode_ts
A space for me to post some of my TS leetcode solutions and possibly revisit/iterate on them.

# About
Using the ts-jest transformer so that I can use Jest to test my TypeScript files.

Running ```npm run test``` runs each test suite and we can also do ```npm run tsc``` to check for type errors as well.

## Scripts
```
"tsc": "tsc",
"test": "jest"
```
